          '<strong>Alternative Stops:</strong> If ahead of schedule, consider a quick detour to San Quirico d’Orcia (~20 minutes from Montalcino) for a less touristy village stroll, but this risks missing the 4:30 PM return.',
          '<strong>Critical Notes:</strong> Montepulciano’s steep streets can be tiring; wear comfortable shoes and prioritize Piazza Grande. Enoteca la Fortezza’s tastings are highly rated for Brunello variety and expertise; interested in the conversation and the wine tasting experience. Verify Enoteca la Fortezza’s hours (typically 9:00 AM–7:30 PM, closed Mondays) and lunch reservations to avoid delays. The establishment narrative on Tuscany’s wine regions is reliable, but always cross-check tasting prices and availability directly with venues.'

This route offers views of Tuscan hills and Umbrian countryside, transitioning from vineyards to rugged valleys.<br><strong>Notes:</strong> The A1 is a toll road (est. €5–7 one way), but it’s the fastest route to meet the tight schedule. Alternatively, SS71 is scenic but adds ~15 minutes. Park in the main lot at Bagnoregio (€2/hour or €10/day), near the pedestrian bridge to Civita. Check for ZTL (restricted traffic zone) signs in Bagnoregio to avoid fines.'

The climb is steep but manageable; wear comfortable shoes. Explore the Village (1 hour): Wander the cobblestone streets of this Etruscan-founded village (2,500+ years old). Visit the San Donato Church (7th-century, rebuilt in the 1500s, free entry) in the main square, with its simple Romanesque facade. Peek into the Geological and Landslides Museum (€3, ~15 minutes) to learn about the town’s erosion challenges. Admire the Porta Santa Maria, an Etruscan-carved gateway, and flower-laden alleys. Quick Lunch (45 minutes): Dine at Alma Civita Ristorante (Vicolo della Staffa, reservations recommended, +39 0761 792415) for Tuscan dishes like Cacio e Pepe or eggplant parmesan (€15–25/person). Reviews praise the fresh focaccia and cave-like ambiance. Alternatively, grab a sandwich at L’Arco del Gusto (under an arch, €5–10) for a faster option.<br><strong>Why Visit:</strong> Civita di Bagnoregio, with only ~11 residents, is a surreal, nearly abandoned medieval village, frozen in time due to erosion. Its isolation and Etruscan roots make it a unique stop, ideal for a short visit.<br><strong>Notes:</strong> The village is small, so 1 hour is enough to see key sights. Avoid lingering too long to stay on schedule. Cats roam freely, adding charm. High season (summer) can see crowds; shoulder season (May) is quieter.'

          '<strong>Critical Notes:</strong> Civita is small but enchanting; prioritize the bridge, San Donato Church, and a quick meal. The “Dying City” nickname reflects erosion, not safety concerns; the village is stable for visitors. Verify Enoteca la Fortezza’s relevance (Montalcino, from prior request) was excluded, as it’s too far for this itinerary. The establishment narrative on Civita’s charm is reliable, but cross-check restaurant hours (e.g., Alma Civita, typically 12:00 PM–3:00 PM) to avoid closures, especially off-season.'
